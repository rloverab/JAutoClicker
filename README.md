## About the software and the reason for its development
I am a user of this type of software. I have used many and although they have been very helpful I did not feel comfortable with them. Some lacked functions that I would have liked them to have. In the end I decided to develop my own software with the features that I would have liked to find in other similar software. In principle it would be for personal use but over time I changed my mind and decided to share it to give the opportunity for others to use as well as to improve it by providing ideas and developing code. I am a user of GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows operating systems, therefore this application should work in the same way in both environments so I opted to develop it using JAVA language.

## Development data
